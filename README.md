# mobius_program
This program computes the Möbius function of the subgroup lattice of a finite group, and the Möbius function for the poset of conjugacy classes of subgroups for a finite group.
Its purpose is to check several conjectures on particular groups to look for patterns or counter examples. This program is written in GAP.
